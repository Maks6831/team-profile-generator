The team profile generator is a NodeJs program which acquires team information from the end user using a series of prompts on the command line interface and creates a html file which displays team member information (email, employee Id etc.). The program uses the Inquirer package to create the prompts, the built in fs package to write files and the built in path package to output the created file to a specific directory. You get to create one manager and an unlimited number of engineers and interns to build your team page. NOTE: in it's current version, the team profile generator only allows one manager. This may change in future revisions.
